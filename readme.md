# basic camera app 

A work in progress.

The main module behind this is [film](https://github.com/NHQ/film), which is also a hack in progress.  

to see this one in action do:

```
git clone ...
cd ...
npm install
browserify entry.js -o public/bundle.js -t brfs
ecstatic /public
```

You must select a webcam to turn on the camera.
